You can try the webpage [here](http://cubed.co.nf/).\r\n\r\n## Our project\r\nWe took the challenge to improve the way you can search for sport facilities in Edinburgh. Using the data from the [The City of Edinburgh Council](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/) we created an interactive 3D map, allowing you to easily search and filter sports by different categories-price, time and activities. After you have selected all options, you can view the results on a map with detailed information about each facility.\r\n## Authors\r\n###Martin Asenov\r\n###Dimitar Dimitrov\r\n###Yordan Hristov\r\n### Boris Penev\r\n###Dimitar Todorov","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
